# CODATA/RDA School for Data Scientists, Security Lectures
Security Lecture material for the RDA CODATA School for Data Scientists. Made for the Trieste School, August 2018.

## 3 Lectures
- Introduction to Security
- Practical Security and Cryptography
- Evening Session of discussion points and crypto exercises

## How to compile?
Each lecture is a latex project. For now, each one should be compiled individually. 
Diagrams have been made with powerpoint (sorry, it's not open source but it was the easiest option...).
